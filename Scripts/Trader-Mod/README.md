# Trader-Mod v7.2
<b>Exile Easy Trader Mod System</b><br>

This trader system is offered free without any guarantee or promise and users should back up their files before proceeding.<br>
It is compiled by [CiC]red_ned of http://cic-gaming.co.uk from different sources including documentation on exilemod and in game from various places.<br>
I have only compiled what i found, attempted to simplify class names and created files for what i couldn't find and is given back to the community as thanks.<br>
If you use then you should consider sharing any further development, bug fixes or expansions (as i have probably missed objects out or spelled things incorrectly).<br>
This file does not include how to install mods or add to loot tables as that is already well documented.<br><br>
