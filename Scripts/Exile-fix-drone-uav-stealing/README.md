Server


In Exile server files you will have to change the following:-

in ExileServer_system_trading_network_purchaseVehicleRequest.sqf change

_vehicleObject setVariable ["ExileOwnerUID", (getPlayerUID _playerObject)];

to

_vehicleObject setVariable ["ExileOwnerUID", (getPlayerUID _playerObject), true];

in ExileServer_object_vehicle_database_load.sqf change

_vehicleObject setVariable ["ExileOwnerUID", (_data select 3)];

to

_vehicleObject setVariable ["ExileOwnerUID", (_data select 3), true];

************************************************************************************

Note 2, check all your server files for where vehicles have ExileOwnerUID set on them as a variable as you will need to make them global by adding ",true" to them as above.
