Default config assumes that Exile Extended Survival pack is installed on the server, highly recommended http://www.exilemod.com/topic/24989-release-extended-survival-pack-mod/  To use on vanilla Exile or with other items mod packs adjust the recipes as per instruction below.

Requires both tools (not consumed) and items (consumed on use). Duct tape and fiberglass, used for repairing, are not consumed by default (despite being in the items list) but instead have a chance to be consumed on each use (simulating running out).

If you are looking for somethig a little simpler, try my general advanced repair script: https://github.com/Bones50/ExileMod-Advanced-Repair 

Install and config intructions included in files.
