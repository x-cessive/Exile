#### a complex mission system for ArmA3 Exile/Epoch Mod
###### ABOUT
VEMFr stands for "VEMF Reloaded". VEMF stands for "Vampire's Epoch Mission Framework".
VEMFr started as VEMF, under my ( IT07 ) continued development.
Initially, VEMF was obviously developed by TheVampire until he discontinued the project.
That is when I took over the project until TheVampire decided to continue VEMF himself.
Then I decided to also continue my work on VEMF but under a new name: VEMFr. And that is how VEMFr was born.

For the sake of comfort, VEMFr uses a separate .pbo to store -and use- settings.
All default settings are stored inside a3_vemf_reloaded.pbo by default. If you want to change a certain setting, then use a3_vemf_reloaded_config\config.cpp for that. It will save you a lot of time. You are welcome.
