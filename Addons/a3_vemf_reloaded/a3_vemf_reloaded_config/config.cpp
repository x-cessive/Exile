	   File: config.cpp
	   Description: put all of the settings you always change in here and simply keep this pbo. Then you don't have to redo all your changes to the config.cpp everytime
	   Description 2: the only thing you will have to do now is simply check the CHANGELOG.md on GitHub everytime there is an update to check if there are any deprecated settings
	   Description 3: instead of changing the config.cpp settings everytime, just add your changes here. Saves a lot of time. Yes you are welcome you lucky bastard
	   Note: it is extremely difficult for a coder to explain with text how to do this so I have put a few examples in this file instead
	   Note 2: the already present lines below line 10 are just examples so feel free to delete them
