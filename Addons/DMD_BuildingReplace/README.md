Simply download the pbo and place it in your @exileserver\addons\ folder

If you wish to make any alterations to the setup, edit config.cpp and adjust accordingly
this can be modified to work with other maps, simply follow the chernarus template in config.cpp  ensure you have the correct worldname.
eg. xcam_taunus for Taunus.

All replaced buildings will be passed into exile's simulation manager once the script has completed, this will ensure players can open and close doors.

You are free to edit, adjust, alter, do whatever you want with this code.
I generally do not offer any support or assistance.
