//Def:  "Explore", spawnloc, patrolloc, radius: - 12 waypoints set up at radius from loc, group moves randomly from point to point
//Def:  "Guard", spawnloc, patrolloc, radius: - group patrols inside of buildings found within radius of loc.
//Def:  "Sentry", spawnloc, patrolloc radius: - group moves to nearest building and takes up station in highest points within the building
//     NOTE: if no buildings are located within 'radius' both Guard and Sentry will locate nearest buildings to the encounter and move there!
//  "Loiter", loc, radius: - group just hangs out, in an unaware mode in vicinity of loc-radius.
//  "Convoy", loc, data: group follows roads from startloc to stoploc, then loops back.
//  "XCountry", loc, data: group goes from startloc to stoploc, then loops back.
