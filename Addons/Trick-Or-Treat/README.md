# Trick-Or-Treat
It's Halloween soon.... Perhaps some Trick or Treating is in order....
You don't need to worry about setting this up now or leaving it in all year... It will automatically only give the option to Trick or Treat on Halloween.

## Instructions
1. Run the TrickOrTreat.SQL script on your database.
2. Drop the PBO found in the server folder into your @ExileServer\Addons folder.
3. Merge/Create as necessary, the files in the client folder with your mission file folder. (#include must go at the top of the config.cpp)
4. Set up the configuration found in GADD_Apps\TrickOrTreat\Config.cpp and edit the GADD_TreatList.sqf to your liking.
5. Re-pack your mission.
6. Stonks.

Feel free to create your own Tricks and add them into the main script. Just follow the formatting and it should work. Also if you create a new trick, upload it here :)

Use the RESET KNOCK.SQL script on your database before next halloween. Otherwise old bases will not allow people to Trick or Treat who knocked last year...
