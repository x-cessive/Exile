/*
	Depends on blck_fnc_addItemToCrate
	
	call as:
	
	[_item,_crate] call blck_fnc_loadLootFromItemsArray;
	
	where
		_crate is a container such as ammo box or vehicle
		_loadout is an array containing either 2 or 3 elements. The first array is always an array of items to add. Items can be formated as ["item1","item1"], as [["item1",3],["item2",2]] or as [["item1",2,4],["item2",3,5]].
		See GMS_fnc_addItemToCrate for information about the acceptable formates for the items "item1" ... "itemN".
		
		The second and optional third element in the array specify the number of times the script will randomly select an item from the array of items and load it into the crate.
		For example:
		case 1: [["item1",...,"itemN"],6]; The script will randomly select from the array of item names 6 times and call the loot loader each time.
		case 2: [["item1",...,"itemN"],6, 9]; As above except that an item will be selected a minimum of 6 and maximum of 9 times.
