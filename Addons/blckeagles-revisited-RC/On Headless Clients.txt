NOTE: you do not need to run @GMS on your HC. Any code needed is broadcast to the HC from the server.
With implementation of the ability to offload AI to clients, the need for HC is probably diminished. Still, should you wish to use them, HC are supported.
The major issues in implementing HC are to assure your HC can connect to the server, which requires adding a few lines to your server.cfg and adding at least once slot for the HC.
See the link to the right for information on updating your server.cfg.  https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Headless_Client
The simplest way to create a slot for the HC is to modify your mission.sqm to convert one currently used for players. 

Epoch add or merge the info below (thanks He-Man for this code)
		class Item105
		{
			dataType="Logic";
			class PositionInfo
			{
				position[]={1444.047,-0.17100525,29465.613};
			};
			name="HC1";
			id=5;
			type="HeadlessClient_F";
			atlOffset=185.799;
		};

Exile: Edit the class for the last player slot as follows:
		class Item37_HC  // Make sure this is something unique
		{
			dataType="Logic";
			class PositionInfo
			{
				position[]={1940.665,12.955395,3410.7729};
				angles[]={6.2805324,0,0};
			};
			name="HC";
			isPlayable=1;
			id=151;
			type="HeadlessClient_F";
			atlOffset=198.9254;
		};

Start your headless client through a bat file or scheduler. Be sure to restart it periodically in some way. The command line for startup from a batch file would look something like this.

@echo off
start "arma3" "arma3server_x64.exe"  -client  -port=2302 -connect 127.0.0.1 -profiles="HC1_Logs" "-mod=@Exile;@Extended_Base_Mod;"
