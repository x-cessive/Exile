## Download

https://github.com/kuplion/ExileZ-Mod

## Installation

1: Edit main settings in 'exilez_mod\config.sqf'.

2: Edit triggers and settings (if required) in 'exilez_mod\triggers\'.

3: Edit zombie classes and loot in 'exilez_mod\zombies\'.

4: Edit the Zombie mission loot in 'exilez_mod\mission\zMissionLootCrate.sqf'.

5: Pack exilez_mod.pbo with either PBO Manager 1.4b x64 (http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=16369) or Eliteness/MikeRo tools if you have them.

6: Place exilez_mod.pbo in your '@ExileServer\addons\' folder.

7: Add "ryanzombies" & "ryanzombiesfunctions" to the "addons" section of your mission.sqm (don't forget to adjust your commas accordingly!!)

addOns[]=
{
	"exile_client",
	"a3_map_altis",
	"Ryanzombies",
	"ryanzombiesfunctions" // Make sure the last entry does not have a comma after it!!
};

## Optional Steps for Database additions

1: Run the SQL file on your database.

2: Add the contents of exile.ini (for your version of extDB3) to the existing exile.ini in the player related queries section.

3: Enable "EZM_EnableZombieStatKill" in the config.

## Configuration

The script is configured to run with Altis, Tanoa, Namalsk, Malden, Chernarus (Normal, Redux, Winter, Summer, and Isles), Napf, Bornholm, Esseker, Al Rayak, Taviana, and Taunus, with all the features enabled by default but will still run on ANY map if an unsupported map is detected.

Almost all of the information related to the configuration is in 'exilez_mod\config.sqf'.

## How to export Triggers positions

1: Open arma with NO MODS other than the map you are using.

2: Open Eden Editor and DO NOT load a mission file.

3: Place an Elliptic Marker *(not a trigger) on every region you want a spawner and set its radius.

4: Start the scenario (run the mission).

5: Copy Paste the code from GetMarkerCmd.txt inside the debug console (press ESC to see it).

6: Execute the code.

7: Open Notepad, CTRL+V / (Paste).

8: ???

9: Profit!
