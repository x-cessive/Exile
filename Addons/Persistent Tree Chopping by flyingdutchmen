For what I've seen in the files,

 

You have to put the content of exile.map in your mission folder. 

 

Be careful, surely you have already the config.cpp and initServer.sqf files on your mission, so on those files you have to merge the content.

 

Find your CfgExileCustomCode and copy

//You have to copy this line inside your CfgExileCustomCode
ExileServer_object_tree_network_chopTreeRequest = "custom\ExileServer_object_tree_network_chopTreeRequest.sqf";	
And then copy:

 

ExecVM "custom\removetrees.sqf";
At the end of your initServer.sqf.

 

Then if you are using 32bits go to: @ExileServer\extDB\sql_custom_v2

 

And copy the content of exile.ini at the end of your exile.ini.

 

And then on mysql workbench or your mysql program run query.sql  to create the tree table.

 

Remember that you have to change the database name in the 2 first lines if your db name is not "exile".

 

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `exile` /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 */;
USE `exile`;

to

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `youDBname` /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 */;
USE `yourDBname`;
