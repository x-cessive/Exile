# A3_vemf_re_reloaded

Vemf_reloaded was originally made by IT07 and last commit on vemf_reloaded was in 2017.
I really like this mission script, but in my opinion it was missing some essential features compared to other mission systems.

So I decided to add and fix some of the stuff for vemf.

Check the Changelog for fixes and new stuff.

**IMPORTANT !!!  If you already have vemf installed itÂ´s important to overwrite your existing files with the vemf_re_reloaded.
			   Then reconfigure the config.cpp to your liking.**

a3_vemf_reloaded a.k.a. VEMFr
a complex mission system for ArmA3 Exile/Epoch Mod
ABOUT
VEMFr stands for "VEMF Reloaded". VEMF stands for "Vampire's Epoch Mission Framework".
VEMFr started as VEMF, under my ( IT07 ) continued development.
Initially, VEMF was obviously developed by TheVampire until he discontinued the project.
That is when I took over the project until TheVampire decided to continue VEMF himself.
Then I decided to also continue my work on VEMF but under a new name: VEMFr. And that is how VEMFr was born.
